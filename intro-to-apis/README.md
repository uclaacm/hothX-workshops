# HOTHX Intro to Web APIs 
**Date:** February 5, 2023 

**Teacher:** [Abigail Tran](https://github.com/abigailtrann) 

Welcome to the HOTHX Intro to Web APIs workshop * ‡©à‚ú©‚Äß‚ÇäÀö  

In this workshop, we will learn all about using Web APIs to integrate existing software systems (like Twitter, Venmo, Spotify, Google Maps) within our own projectüßë‚Äçüíªüíªüì≤

## Topics Covered
- [APIs]()
- [Servers and Clients]()
- [HTTP]()
- [Spotify Walkthrough]()
- [Back to APIs]()

## What is an API?
API stands for **A**plication **P**rogramming **I**nterface. This may sound complicated, but they really they just a way for two computers- a client and a server** to communicate. Some examples of APIs you may have encountered before are Venmo, Google Maps, and Twitterbots. Venmo payment is done through to ensure that the end application can only do what it needs to accomplish without being exposed to sensitive data or gaining access to unwelcome privileges
APIs.

## What even is a Server? or a Client? And how do they Interact????!!
Servers are just like any regular old computer. The only difference is that they have the task of listening and responding to requests from other computers called **clients.** 

Here, let's use a restaurant analogy to better explain this: Clients are like the customers ordering. Just like how a customer can request a glass of water or an order of sushi, a client can request some function to be performed or data to be processed and returned. The request goes to the kitchen which acts as the **server** (not to be confused with waiter). Now how does this request go to the kitchen? The waiter communicates the request to the kitchen and also brings the food from the kitchen similar to an **API**, which acts as a middle man between a client and a server. 

The benefit: you can enjoy the yummy products of the restaurant's work without having to know how to make it yourself. This way, the restaurant can provide their services to anyone who knows how to speak the language. But while a customer may order in English or Mandarin, clients and servers use

## HTTP :P
HTTP stands for Hyper

```class ProfilePage extends React.Component { //making a copmponent and this is what will be shown on the localhost
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = { //creating four states or variables called spotufy, authenticated, displayName, and topartists
            spotify: new SpotifyWebApi(), //what we need to connect with the api
            authenticated: false,
            displayName: "",
            topArtists: [],
        };
    }

    componentDidMount() {
        const token = getToken(); //getToken is an api call
        this.state.spotify.setAccessToken(token); // tokens are proof of authentiation,common in apps that you log in, you get a token when user logs in and you basically give it to server (spotify) and server gives data back 
        this.state.spotify.getMe().then( //.then is async,, ensures 21 and 22 go after getme() function fulfills promise
            (me) => this.setState({ displayName: me.display_name }), //expecting an argument called me,, setting display name state to whatever display name is in the me object
            (error) => console.log("Error loading profile data: ", error) //if there is an error that exists, print th eerror to the console so you can see what it is and debug
        );

        this.state.spotify 
            .getMyTopArtists({ // its an APi call and all API calls returns a promise, once we have our top artists, then it will run everything in .then
                limit: 20, //20 top artists
            })
            .then( //go here after getMyTopArtists resolves, promise is no longer promise bc it resolved and got our data
                (artistsData) => { //we expect getmytopartists to return artist data
                    let artists = []; //create empty array of artists, so that we can hold artists as we iterate the artists that are returned
                    artistsData.items.forEach((artist) =>{ //loops through every single item (every artist) in artistData.items
                        console.log(artist); //prints to the website
                        artists.push(artist.name) //add artist name to empty array artists we created in 31
                    }
                    ); //we are out of the loop but we are still in the .then function

                    this.setState({
                        topArtists: artists, //set top artists equal to artists
                        authenticated: true, //make user authenticated so we can render later
                    });
                },
                (error) => console.log("Error loading top artists: ", error) //if its an error then say error loading artists
            );
          
    }

    render() { //everything we show on website
        // If the user isn't fully authenticated, don't render anything yet
        // This shouldn't be the case for longer than a fraction of a second
        if (!this.state.authenticated) return null;

        // Log out by navigating back to the home page
        const logout = () => this.props.navigate("/");
        ```
